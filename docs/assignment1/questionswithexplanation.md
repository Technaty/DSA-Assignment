5. Combined Time Complexity
The combined time complexity of two nested loops is the product of their individual time complexities. In this case, the outer loop has a time complexity of O(n), and the inner loop has a time complexity of O(m). Therefore, the combined time complexity is O(n * m).
The printOut() method is a recursive function that prints an integer n to the console, one digit at a time. It works by first checking if n is greater than or equal to 10. If it is, the function recursively calls itself with the value of n / 10. This effectively divides the number by 10 and prints the remainder (the last digit) to the console. The function then prints the current digit (n % 10) to the console.

Example:

printOut(12345);
Step-by-step execution:

Check if n (12345) is greater than or equal to 10. It is, so call the printOut() method with the value of n / 10 (1234).
Check if n (1234) is greater than or equal to 10. It is, so call the printOut() method with the value of n / 10 (123).
Check if n (123) is greater than or equal to 10. It is, so call the printOut() method with the value of n / 10 (12).
Check if n (12) is greater than or equal to 10. It is, so call the printOut() method with the value of n / 10 (1).
Check if n (1) is greater than or equal to 10. It is not, so print the remainder (n % 10) (1) to the console.
Print the current digit (n % 10) (4) to the console.
Print the current digit (n % 10) (3) to the console.
Print the current digit (n % 10) (2) to the console.
Print the current digit (n % 10) (1) to the console.
Output:

12345
Time complexity:

The time complexity of the printOut() method is O(log(n)). This is because the function recursively calls itself with the value of n / 10 until n is less than 10. At that point, the function simply prints the remainder (n % 10) to the console and returns. This process takes log(n) steps, since dividing a number by 10 is equivalent to multiplying it by 0.1, which is less than 1.

Conclusion:

The printOut() method is a recursive function that prints an integer n to the console, one digit at a time. It has a time complexity of O(log(n)).
